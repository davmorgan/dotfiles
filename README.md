# Dotfiles (ZSH)

This repository is for my dotfiles. Feel free to pull and customize as you wish. Pull requests are welcome also!

Thakn you to Zach Holman (@holman) for many great ideas and the implmenentation style.

## Installation
Installation is quite easy, you just need to pull the repo and run rake.

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/rvalente/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
rake
```

This will setup your .gitconfig, install all the necessary submodules for git, and backup all your existing files.
